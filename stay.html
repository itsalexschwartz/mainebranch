        <h2>Getting There</h2>

        <h3>Address</h3>
        Maine Branch is located at 16 Tidewater Ln, Arrowsic, Maine. Google Maps should be accurate but the road is fairly new so older GPS'es might have trouble identifying the address.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        When you're heading south on Old Stage Road, you'll see Tidewater Lane on your left. Turn here and go ~500 ft and you'll see #16 on your left. Make the left and drive past the studio buildings all the way down to the house, at the end of the driveway. Here's a map:

        <h2> House Manual</h2>

        <h3>Entry</h3>
        All doors will be unlocked and can remain unlocked during your stay.

        <h3>Parking</h3>
        The site includes 3 buildings at the top of the hill and 1 main house at the bottom of the hill. Park wherever you'd like but it's generally more convenient to drive all the way to the bottom of the hill and park at the <a href="images/parking.jpg">foot of the stairs or by the rocks / shed ðŸ“· </a>

        <h3>Heating and Cooling</h3>
        The house and the studios are all heated and cooled via heat pumps. The thermostat in the main house is found next to the washer/drier. The temperature for the 3 outbuildings are controlled by remote control located in each building.

        <h3>Kayaks</h3>
        There are two kayaks located by the waterfront that are free to use. Kayak paddles are located in the outdoor shower area. 

        <h3>WIFI</h3>
        Wifi connection instructions:
        <br /><b>name: mainebranch</b>
        <br /><b>pass: househouse</b>

        <h3>Stovetop</h3>
        The stovetop is a touch-screen interface. Push your finger on the Power icon in the bottom right to enable the induction stovetop. Once its powered on, each burner can be powered on individually and dialed up or down in intensity using the touch-screen slider.

        <h3>Washer/Drier</h3>
        The washer and drier are a single ventless unit. Pick wash and dry to do a single cycle that first washes then dries your clothes in one cycle.

        <h3>Wood Stoves</h3>
        Please do not use the wood stoves without owner approval.

        <h3>Wood fired hot tub</h3>
        Please do not use the wood-fired hot tub as it is drained for the summer. It should only be used if you've received explicit instructions and setup from Alex.

        <h3>Espresso Machine</h3>
        Please do not use the espresso machine as it is a manual machine and is very finnicky and easy to damage.

        <h3>Check-in and check-out</h3>
        Please take trash bags to the trash bins and recycling to the blue recycling bin (bins are located on the back side of the house). Please remove pillowcases and sheets from the beds and leave them on the floor for the cleaners on your way out.

        <h3>Issues?</h3>
        Feel free to text Alex at 203-560-8034 with any concerns.
